### Overview

We encourage the submission of posters discussing works in progress, new research directions, and challenges related to the field of learning-augmented algorithms (broadly construed). Topics include, but are not limited to, theoretical work on the design and analysis of such algorithms with provable performance guarantees, as well as emerging applications that evaluate the real-world impact of algorithms with predictions on various systems or problems.  Poster submissions may present exploratory ideas, vision statements, ongoing research, preliminary results, or recently published work on relevant topics.

### Important Dates and Submission Site

Submission deadline: **April 1, 2026, Anywhere on Earth (AoE)**

Notification of acceptance: **April 15, 2026**

Workshop: **June 12, 2026**

Submission site: https://sigmetrics26-lata.hotcrp.com/

### Submission Guidelines

Abstract submissions must be prepared using the double-column Performance Evaluation Review (PER) format ([template available here](https://github.com/learning-augmented-algorithms/learning-augmented-algorithms.github.io/raw/refs/heads/main/lata_template.zip)), using up to 2 pages (not including references) in PDF format.  The submission should include the names and affiliations of the contributors, a title, a brief abstract, and a summary of the contributions; preliminary results may also be included.  If the poster presents results of a recently-published paper in another venue, bibliographic references to the full paper (authors, title, and venue) must be included.  Submissions violating these formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected.

### Review Process

Submitted posters will be reviewed between April 1st and April 15th.  The review will focus primarily on relevance to the workshop’s scope and likelihood of leading to interesting discussions at the workshop. 

### Accepted Posters

Authors of accepted contributions should prepare a physical poster for the workshop poster session (any size up to 48 inches x 60 inches is acceptable).  Some posters will be invited to give a 10-15min (conference-style) short presentation during a talk session.  After the workshop, revised versions of the poster abstracts will be published in a special issue of [Performance Evaluation Review](https://www.sigmetrics.org/per.shtml), with an extra page allowed to address reviewer comments and/or summarize discussions from the workshop.  Authors of abstracts grant ACM permission to publish them in print and digital formats, although PER does not claim copyright (as stated in the template)—authors retain copyright of their work with complete freedom to submit their work elsewhere.
