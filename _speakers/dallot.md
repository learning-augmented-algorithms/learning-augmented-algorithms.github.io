Hello! I'm Julien Dallot and I'm trying to better understand the possibilities offered by Learning-Augmented algorithms during my PhD.  My study what happens when mixing randomness and predictions together: I want to improve upon the deterministic setting and to derive lower-bounds that are independent from any error measure of the prediction.  More specifically, I'm working on models such as Infused Advice or robustness/consistency analysis with randomness.
